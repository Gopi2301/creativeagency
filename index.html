        <p class="text-h2">How to set up your design</p>
        <p class="text-para-3">Rack mount LCD monitors can save you a lot of space and help you form a convenient and
            efficient desktop for your work or home study. The rack mount is set up so that the keyboard and LCD monitor
            are on a sliding rack that lest you move them out from your desk or over it. Once you decide to invest in
            the rack mount LCD monitor, you will have to install the rack and the monitor. Here, then, are steps in
            installing rack mount LCD monitors.</p>

        <p class="text-para-3">The first step in installing rack mount LCD monitors is to get out and get one. They are
            available at most any home office or electronics store. Since the rack mounts are becoming more popular,
            they are easier to find now then aver before. Once you have your set, bring it home and spread all of the
            parts out along with the instructions so you can find what you need.</p>
        <p class="text-para-3">
            The first step will be to install the slides on your desk. Some rack mounting sets will include slides that
            are “handed.” That means that each slide is assigned a side of the monitor rack, but there are also sets
            where either slide can go on either side. Consult the instructions with your set to make sure you have
            mounted them correctly.</p>

            second thought such as Coca Cola, body muscles and holding ones own breath. Though, most of these notes are
            not fundamentally necessary, they are such that you can use them for a good laugh, at a drinks party or for
            picking up women or men.</p>
